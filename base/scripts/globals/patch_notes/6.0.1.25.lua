What's New

- Treasure Hunting

- There are 3 stages to hunting treasure
  - Decipher: This allows you to identify some basic information about the map.
      - Failing to decipher the map has a chance to severely damage it.
      - Deciphering will tell you what region of the world the treasure is buried in
      - It also determines how accurate the map is. The accuracy determines the size of the area the map leads you to.
      - Depending on your skill, you have a small chance to get a precise map. These require no skill to study and dig up and can be sold to players with no treasure hunting skill.
  - Study: This leads you to the general area where the treasure is buried
      - If you are not in the correct region of the map it will just tell you to go to that region
      - Failing to study the map will slightly damage it (you can fail up to 9 times on an undamaged map)
      - Successful study will give you a NSEW direction towards the area
  - Dig: Once you are in the general area, you use a shovel to dig up the treasure.
      - Digging the correct location will spawn the treasure chest and harder maps may spawn monsters

- Sunken Chests

- There are 3 stages to fishing up a sunken chest.
  - Fishing up a map:
      - Fishing treasure maps have a random chance to drop when fishing.
  - Study: Studying a map will tell you what region of the world the treasure is buried in
      - If you are not in the correct region of the map it will just tell you to go to that region
      - Studying within the correct region will give you a NSEW direction towards the area
  - Fish: Once you are in the general area, you can fish to attempt to unconver the treasure.
