--- This module is no longer used, it has been replaced by the global static helpers guard.lua and some registers in player.lua,

-- Stuff that still has this module will not be protected by guards by default, if you wish for them to be protected
	-- by guards, you must add a karma ObjVar to them, as long as the karma level is guard protected (Outcast for example isn't)
	-- then they will be guard protected.
